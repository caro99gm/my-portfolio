            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm a second year student of Computer Science in Instituto 
                        Tecnologico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey. I'm from 
                        Mexico, more precisely from Guadalajara but I'm studying 
                        in Monterrey city.</p>
            <h3>A little bit of my background in CS...</h3>
            <p>I decided to study CS since I was in High School, one of my 
                        biggest influences on this decision were my parents because 
                        they are both computer scientists, so when I was little I always 
                        saw their job and I get interested in that. Due to this, since 
                        middle school, I started to get involved in CS area and also in 
                        some stuff of robotics.</p>
            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>I really enjoy spending time with my friends, also watching 
                        series and movies, I love animated and science fiction! but 
                        also the dramas when I'm in that mood... Besides, I enjoy arts, 
                        like painting or drawing but my favorite technique is with color 
                        pencils. As well I love music, I do not play any instrument and 
                        I do not have a favorite gender, the music I hear is depending 
                        on what I'm doing and my mood at that moment, so it can be very 
                        different.</p>
            <h3>In more nerdy things...</h3>
            <p>I love math! since I was in elementary school I get involved in 
                        Kumon (a math program) and my objective was always to end the 
                        program, so I did, but when that happened I just do not have 
                        another thing to dedicate so much time, so that I start working 
                        as an instructor in all levels.</p>
            <p>Also, I love astronomy, actually, I'm not very involved, but 
                        getting to know more about it is one of my goals. Another thing 
                        that I enjoy a lot is coding, time just runs so fast! I'm 
                        looking to get deeper into the languages that I already know.</p>

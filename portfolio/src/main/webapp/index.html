                        <h2>About me</h2>
                        <p>Hi! I'm a second year student of Computer Science in Instituto Tecnologico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey. I'm from Mexico, more precisely from Guadalajara but I'm studying in Monterrey city.</p>
                        <h3>A little bit of my background in CS...</h3>
                        <p>I decided to study CS since I was in High School, one of my biggest influences on this decision were my parents because they are both computer scientists, so when I was little I always saw their job and I get interested in that. Due to this, since middle school, I started to get involved in CS area and also in some stuff of robotics.</p>
                        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                        <p>I really enjoy spending time with my friends, also watching series and movies, I love animated and science fiction! but also the dramas when I'm in that mood... Besides, I enjoy arts, like painting or drawing but my favorite technique is with color pencils. As well I love music, I do not play any instrument and I do not have a favorite gender, the music I hear is depending on what I'm doing and my mood at that moment, so it can be very different.</p>
                        <h3>In more nerdy things...</h3>
                        <p>I love math! since I was in elementary school I get involved in Kumon (a math program) and my objective was always to end the program, so I did, but when that happened I just do not have another thing to dedicate so much time, so that I start working as an instructor in all levels.</p>
                        <p>Also, I love astronomy, actually, I'm not very involved, but getting to know more about it is one of my goals. Another thing that I enjoy a lot is coding, time just runs so fast! I'm looking to get deeper into the languages that I already know.</p>
